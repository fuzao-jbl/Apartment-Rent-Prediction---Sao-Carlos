# Appartment-Rent-Prediction---Sao-Carlos
This repository shows a machine learning model that can estimate the value of appartment rents in the city of SÃ£o Carlos,  state of Sao Paolo, in Brazil.

The Jupyter notebooks shows how I have fetched the data and reasons why I have choosen the decision tree regression as my machine learning model.
I have saved the pipeline to work with raw data and the model using pickle
At last, the cliapp is actually just a simple program that loads the pipeline, the model and asks for data, then it predicts the rent price.
